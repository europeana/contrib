The YUMA Annotation Server
--------------------------

WARNING: The YUMA Annotation Server is not yet completed. The documentation
below is PRELIMINARY DEVELOPER DOC! And not yet suitable for end users!
Please contact rainer.simon@ait.ac.at for further details.

UPDATE: You can check out a sandbox instance of the YUMA Annotation Server at

http://dme.ait.ac.at/yuma-server

Some more online documentation (included in the server) can be found at 

http://dme.ait.ac.at/yuma-server/doc

TODOs
-----

- Split FormatHandler into two separate classes (for parsing and serialization).
- Integrate the Europeana Annotation API as a 'backend'.
- Implement OAC Model
- REST authentication between client suite and server!
- JSON and RDF export of list view contents (search results, feed pages)
- Think of a decent solution for implementing SemanticTag's 'GeoLocation'.
- Map view (once GeoLocation is done)
- Think about a 'dump database' feature (in the admin section)
- Last but not least: more & better unit tests. Also look into Wicket tooling for
  Web tests.

Requirements
------------
The YUMA Annotation Server requires Java 1.6, a Servlet container such as
Tomcat 6, and a relational database such as Postgres 8.3. All configuration
parameters are located in the web.xml.

Alternatively, YUMA Server can also be run with a MongoDB NoSQL-DB backend.
MongoDB implementation is not yet complete yet - for now it is recommended
to stick to an RDBMS.

Build
-----
YUMA Server is built with Ant. Use the default 'create-war' target to 
build the .war file.

After Deployment
----------------
After deployment, YUMA Server provides various Web pages and HTTP end-points.

- A REST interface for annotation CRUD operations in JSON format is 
  available at http://localhost:8080/yuma-server/api (or similar, depending
  on your setup). For format documentation, please consult source code.
  
- Various annotation RSS feeds are available at 
  http://localhost:8080/yuma-server/feeds
  Consult source code for details and available feeds. 

- The Web fronted is available at the root path
  http://localhost:8080/yuma-server (or similar)
  and provides access to annotation search.
  
- There are also Web pages for each available RSS feed. E.g. the public
  timeline is available at
  http://localhost:8080/pages/Timeline
  Consult source code for details and further available pages.
